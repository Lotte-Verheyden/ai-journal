A modern journaling application that gets you reflecting deeper by generating personal, context-aware follow-up questions. Next to that, the styling of the journal is made to make the practice of journaling more joyous.

### How does it work

You start by typing how your day went. The goal is to just let you type, remove the hurdle of phrasing it a certain way, don't think too much about it (when you're done, use command + Enter to submit).
The AI journal will pick up on it and have a small chat conversation with you. The goal is to let you reflect a bit deeper on your day. Throughout this chat, the journal will ask 3 questions:
- the first question lets you go deeper into one aspect of your day. This will be done by asking one of 4 types of questions: reframer, challenger, meta-reflector, or deepener question.
- the second and third question are designed to make you zoom out, think out of the box and get you out of your initial train of thought. They will be 2 (randomly chosen) out of these categories: environments & places, gratitude & highlights, imagination & metaphors, learning & growing, micromoments & joys, people & relationships, senses & embodiment. 

After reflecting and answering these questions, a prompt for an accompanying image will be proposed. You can change the prompt, and when you're ready, click "generate image". The journal entry will be saved with this image.

### A background that changes throughout the day

Your brain feels different throughout the day, and so should your journal. The colors of the journal will move together with the colors of the sky. In the morning, the colors are blue, during sunset it's pink, and at night it's dark purple.
